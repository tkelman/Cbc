Prerequisites for installation:
- at the moment on (*)nix platforms you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build Osi library and unitTest
  - read and edit the top of Makefile to select
      - whether shared or static library should be built
      - optimization level
      - where the compiled library should be installed
        If you want to use the Volume Algorithm as a solver then first
        you must build and install libvol. See Vol/INSTALL in the COIN
        root directory.
  - read and edit ../Makefiles/Makefile.locations to uncomment Clp lines
  - 'make' to build and install the library.
  - 'make unitTest' to create the unitTest program. It will be placed
    in the target subdirectory.

  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

To run Osi unitTest
  - unitTest from Osi directory

To build Cbc executable
  In This directory 'make unitTest'.  This actually creates and executable
    cbc in this directory which can both do unit test and act as simple
    driver.
  Cbc is fairly complex in that it needs:
    Cbc, Clp, Coin, Osi and Cgl

  It has been slightly tested with Osl instead of Clp.  It worked but
	more slowly as it was harder to give hints to OSL or switch off
	output etc.

Samples/sample2.cpp is preferred driver
